To customize the editor, change to the tab "Settings" while logged in to CorA.

Here, you can:

+ **Change your password** by clicking on the respective button.

+ **Configure the number of lines to be shown on a page.** For sake of clarity,
  the editor only displays a certain number of lines at once.  Also, to provide
  some context when annotating, the editor can repeat the last few lines of a
  page at the beginning of the next one ("overlapping lines").  You can
  customize both of these values here, then click "Confirm line settings".

    *(Note: A high number of lines per page may slow down your browser
     significantly.  Change to a lower value in case you experience performance
     issues.)*

+ **Hide/show certain columns in the editor.** Uncheck a box to hide the
  respective column in the [editor table](doc-annotate.md#the-editor-table).
  While you've opened a document, only columns present in that document will be
  shown here.

+ **Customize the
  [horizontal text preview](doc-annotate.md#horizontal-text-preview).** Choose
  if you want to see the "trans" or "utf" representation of tokens in the text
  preview field, or turn the preview window off.

+ **Toggle highlighting of problematic tags.** When turned on, tags
  [marked as "needing correction"](admin-tagsets.md) will be highlighted with a
  red border in the editor.
