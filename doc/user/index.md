**CorA** (short for *Corpus Annotator*) is a web-based annotation tool that was
specifically developed for use with non-standard language data, such as
historical documents, social media texts, or learner data.

It runs on any modern web browser (we recommend [Chrome][], though [Firefox][]
and [Safari][] should work as well) as long as JavaScript is enabled and you
have an active internet connection.  The
[source code](https://github.com/comphist/cora/) is provided under the
[MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), which means you are free to
use, copy, or modify it for any purpose, including commercially.

For additional information about the tool, please visit the
[CorA project website](http://www.linguistics.rub.de/comphist/resources/cora/).

!!! note "Note"
    + If you are **totally unfamiliar with CorA**, start with
      the [introduction](intro.md), which talks about the basic concepts
      and functionality of the software.

    + If you are a **server administrator planning to run CorA on your own web
      server**, start with the sections
      on [installing](setup-install.md) and [configuring](setup-config.md)
      the tool, then look at the pages under "Administrative Tasks."

    + If you are a **user working with an existing CorA installation**, jump
      straight to the [information on using the editor](doc-annotate.md), then
      also take a look at the other pages under "Working on Documents."
