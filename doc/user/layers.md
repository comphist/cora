CorA supports various types of annotations: part-of-speech tags, lemmatization,
normalization, etc. --- we refer to them as **annotation layers** (or,
sometimes, **tagsets**[^tagsets]).

Annotation layers have to be associated with (or "linked to") documents in order
to use them.  This way, you can customize which annotation columns should appear
in the editor.  You can also have multiple projects that use different layers,
different POS tagsets, etc.  These associations must be defined by an
administrator, either in the [project settings](admin-projects.md) or, if
needed, [for individual texts](doc-manage.md#tagset-links).

#### Open vs. closed layers

An important distinction is that between open- and closed-class annotation
layers:

+ **Open annotation layers** do not place restrictions on the possible
  annotation values.  In the editor, they are typically represented by a text
  box which accepts arbitrary input.

    Instances of these annotation layers are created automatically and can
    simply be selected when linking annotation layers to documents.

    Example: *lemmatization*

+ **Closed annotation layers** have a fixed set of allowed annotation values.
  In the editor, values are typically selected from a dropdown box.

    Because of this, instances of these annotation layers need to be [created
    manually in the "Administration" tab](admin-tagsets.md) by providing a
    name and a list of allowed values ('tags').  This also means that,
    contrary to open-class layers, there can be several instances of the same
    closed annotation layer, but with different tag lists.

    Example: *POS*

## List of annotation layers

Here is a list of all annotation layers that CorA currently supports.  Each
layer has an internal "type", i.e. a short abbreviation which identifies it.
This type string is used when [importing tagsets](admin-tagsets.md) and also
appears in XML tags when exporting documents in [CorA-XML format](coraxml.md).

Name                                  | Type           | Class
------------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------
[Part-of-speech](#part-of-speech-pos) | pos            | closed
[Lemmatization](#lemmatization)       | lemma          | open
[Lemma suggestion](#lemma-suggestion) | lemma_sugg     | closed
[Lemma part-of-speech](#lemma-part-of-speech) | lemmapos | closed
[Normalization](#normalization)       | norm           | open
[Modernization](#modernization)       | norm_broad     | open
[Modernization type](#modernization-type) | norm_type  | closed
[Boundaries](#boundaries)             | boundary       | closed
[Comments](#comments-secondary-comments) | comment        | open
[Secondary comments](#comments-secondary-comments) | sec_comment    | open

### Part-of-speech (POS)

Part-of-speech annotation in form of a closed tagset, optionally containing
morphological information as well.  In the editor, this annotation layer is
represented by two separate columns: "POS" and "Morphology".  When making a
selection in the "POS" dropdown box, the contents of the "Morphology" dropdown
box change to only allow values that form legal tags with the chosen "POS"
entry.

However, it is important to note that these **two columns are conflated
internally**, and actually represent a single annotation of the value
"*<POS\>.<Morphology\>*" --- a **dot (.)** acts as a separator between the two.

In a tag value, everything preceding the first dot is considered to be the
(base) "POS" tag, while everything following it is treated as belonging to
"Morphology".  An exception is made for tags having a single dot at the end,
because some tagsets use tags like "*$.*" for punctuation.  Note that you
are *not required* to use morphological attributes in your tags --- it is
perfectly fine to use tagsets with only plain POS tags; the "Morphology" column
can be [conveniently hidden](doc-customize.md) in this case.

### Lemmatization

Lemma annotation is an open annotation layer represented by a text box.

Lemmatization always comes with a **lemma verification checkbox** that turns
green when you click on it.  When entering a lemma, the system will search for
suggestions based on *identical tokens with a marked lemma verification
checkbox* in all texts within the current project, and display them in bold
green:

![](img/layers-lemma.png)
{: .figure .align-center}

Lemma entry with marked verification checkbox and a lemma suggestion
{: .figure-caption .align-center}

The verification checkbox becomes unchecked when you modify the lemma entry, and
becomes checked when you select a green (= verified) suggestion from the list.

Automatical lemma suggestions can also be provided by adding the
[lemma suggestion](#lemma-suggestion) annotation layer.

### Lemma suggestion

Provides auto-completion suggestions for [lemma annotations](#lemmatization).

Strictly speaking, this isn't an annotation layer at all; rather, it provides an
*additional resource* to another annotation layer, the
[lemmatization](#lemmatization) layer.  When using lemma suggestions, the lemma
text field will provide **auto-completion suggestions** to the user based on the
string that he entered and the values in the lemma suggestion "tagset".  A
maximum of twenty suggestions can be shown at a time.

![](img/layers-lemma_sugg.png)
{: .figure .align-center}

Auto-completion for lemmata based on a pre-defined list of lemma suggestions
{: .figure-caption .align-center}

In the auto-completion list, values in **square brackets** at the end of the
string are displayed in light grey; a possible use case for this is IDs
referring to an external lexicon.  Apart from the distinctive rendering, these
strings are not treated in any special way, though.

Special characters, such as accented letters, are conflated with their "simple"
counterparts to a certain degree,[^conflation] so that entering 'a' in the lemma
field would find auto-complete suggestions like 'à' or 'âme'.

### Lemma part-of-speech

Part-of-speech annotation for the lemmatization, in case you want to distinguish
between POS annotation of the wordform versus the lemma.

Like the usual [part-of-speech annotation](#part-of-speech-pos), this is a
closed tagset and represented by a dropdown box, but with two important
differences:

1. It supports only one dropdown box (i.e., there is no such thing as "lemma
   morphology").

2. If the lemma part-of-speech is empty and the user selects a (token)
   part-of-speech tag, the lemma POS field will auto-select the first entry
   that *begins with the same string* as the selected POS tag. (For example, if
   the user annotates part-of-speech with "VVIMP", the lemma POS field might
   auto-select the tag "VV", if such a tag exists.)

### Normalization

Normalization is an open annotation layer represented by a text box, and
intended for some kind of "standardized" form of the annotated token (e.g.,
modern forms of historical words, tokens with corrected spelling, long forms of
abbreviations, ...).

There is no special functionality attached to the text field, except that it can
be used as input for [external annotators](admin-taggers.md#tagger-interfaces)
in place of the original token.

### Modernization

Modernization is an open annotation layer represented by a text box, and
intended to be a "broader" form of [normalization](#normalization).

As long as it's empty, the associated text box will show a grayed-out copy of
the [normalization](#normalization) field.  This reflects our original intention
that modernization only needs to be annotated if it would actually differ from
normalization.  In practice, since it is a simple text box, you can use the
field in any way you like.

You can find more details about our own definition of "modernization" (as well
as ["modernization type"](#modernization-type)) in the following paper:

> *Bochumer Linguistische Arbeitsberichte:* 15.

### Modernization type

Modernization type is a closed tagset, represented as a dropdown box that is
conditioned on [modernization](#modernization): it is only active when the
modernization field is filled.

!!! attention "Attention"
    It is not particularly useful to have a "modernization
    type" without "modernization", since the dropdown box will always be
    disabled in this case.

It can be used to specify the type of content in the modernization column.  You
can find more details about our intended meaning of "modernization type" (as
well as ["modernization"](#modernization)) in the following paper:

> Julia Krasselt, Marcel Bollmann, Stefanie Dipper, and Florian Petran
> (2015). [Guidelines für die Normalisierung historischer deutscher Texte / Guidelines for Normalizing Historical German Texts.](http://www.linguistics.rub.de/bla/015-krasselt_etal2015.pdf)
> *Bochumer Linguistische Arbeitsberichte:* 15.

### Boundaries

Boundary annotation consists of a check box combined with a dropdown box; the
dropdown box is only active when the checkbox is checked.

![](img/layers-boundary.png)
{: .figure .align-center}

Boundary annotations
{: .figure-caption .align-center}

This layer is intended for marking structural boundaries, such as phrase,
clause, or sentence boundaries.  Activating the checkbox marks the respective
token as a boundary, while the dropdown box can be used to further specify the
type of boundary.

### Comments / Secondary comments

Comments are represented by a text box that can be used in any way you wish.  It
grows larger while active (e.g. by clicking into it), to make it easier to read
and write longer comments.

In case you'd like to distinguish between two types of comments (e.g. comments
for internal use vs. comments to be included in a released corpus), there is
another annotation layer for "secondary comments" which is functionally
identical to "comments".


## List of flags

Flags are represented as checkboxes in the editor table that can be marked or
unmarked.  They can be bound to annotation layers and only appear when that
layer is present, but they are treated separately from other annotations.  Here
is a list of the currently supported flags; follow the links to find out more
about their intended usage.  The internal 'name' string is used when
representing flags in [CorA-XML format](coraxml.md).

Function                                                        | Name
--------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------
[Generic error marking ('E')](doc-annotate.md#the-editor-table) | general error
[Lemma verification](#lemmatization)                            | lemma verified
[Boundary marking](#boundaries)                                 | boundary



[^tagsets]: This is for historical reasons: since POS annotation came first, and
it is common to speak of a "POS tagset", the term "tagset" has been generalized
to all annotation layers that were added afterwards.  Hence, "tagset" is
sometimes used even for annotations like lemmata or normalization (which do not
really have a tagset in the usual sense).

[^conflation]: To be precise, the character conflation happens in the database
query, possibly depending on the MySQL version on the server, according to
the ["utf8_general_ci"
collation chart](http://collation-charts.org/mysql60/mysql604.utf8_general_ci.european.html).
